Forecasting Bristolâ€™s Air Pollution Using Bayesian Networks
</h1>

The goal of this project was to  generate a dynamic model to predict dangerously high levels of NO in Bristol. The model was built using dynamic bayesian networks and trained from publically available data sourced from three local weather stations. Traffic data and extrapolated as exact data was not avaiable.


The report detailing all aspects of the project can be viewed [here](/report.pdf).


This work was created as part of a group project for the *Maths and Data Modelling* Unit at the University of Bristol.


The project involved the use of the following technologies:

- Python
- Pandas
- TQDM
- Matplotlib
